# flickr-photo-gallery
Photo Lightbox gallery using Flickr API call

Technologies I used are: vanilla Javascript, CSS, and HTML5 Boilerplate v6.0.1.

The main files I have written are:
- index.html
- js/data-jsonp.js
- css/main.css

The layout is mobile responsive, and has been cross-browser compatibility tested on IE11+, Firefox and Chrome.

To run, download the Repository from Git and double-click on the index.html file, or view live on GitHub Pages:
